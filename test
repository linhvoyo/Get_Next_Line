Summary: High throughput DNA sequencers primarily generate data in the FASTQ format nilson fuckwad.
This format is often used as input for DNA/RNA analysis pipelines.
However, post processing, the data is often stored and shared in 
different formats, such as BAM, SAM, CRAM, and/or SRA.
A major challenge to using shared data is the inconsistency in the format of stored sequence information.
As processed data often does not contain all the information needed to regenerate the original FASTQ data.
Thus, most commonly used FASTQ converters, such as Picard, Bedtools, and Samtools would either fail to generate
output or FASTQ data that require further manipulation before they’re processible.
The FASTQ data would contain duplicates entries. 
In 
addition, for paired – end data, read orders and the number of reads differ between read 1 and read 2 files. 
Here, we describe a robust approach for converting stored sequencing data to FASTQ format suitable for downstream processing and analysis.
